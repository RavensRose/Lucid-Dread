# Lucid Dread

<h3>How far can you go?</h3>
<p>Lucid Dread is an atmospheric VR psychological horror experience that challenges your perception of reality.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: you find yourself isolated in a farmhouse, surrounded by an endless, isolating cornfield. There is no one to help you. There is only the routine. As the days progress, the farmhouse slowly dissolves into a surreal nightmare.</p>
<p>The game unfolds through a hidden narrative, where the player can find scattered clues across chapters to uncover the dark truth behind the story.
The journey will be released in four distinct Acts. Each chapter introduces unique mechanics and sensory challenges designed to push the features of VR technology and hardware performance.</p>
